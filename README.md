# Computer Vision Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects I worked on to learn more about computer vision.

## Projects
- MNIST Classifier: My first computer vision project.  A simple CNN-based classifier for the MNIST fashion dataset.  My goal for this project was to become familiar with CNNs and key computer vision concepts.
- MNSIT GAN: A Deep Generative Adversarial Network for the MNIST fashion dataset.  My goal for this project was to explore more advanced computer vision concepts and learn more about generative algorithms.
- Neural Style Transfer: Code to generate an oil-painting style image of Baker Tower.  My goal for this project was to build upon my MNIST GAN and explore more advanced generative algorithms.  This algorthm seemed like an extremely elegant application of the hierarchical image representations learned by a CNN, so I wanted to implement it and use it to generate my own images.

## Notes
- All files were written in Python 3.10
- All files were written in Google Colab with the default Colab library versions.  Colab is a good environment to run these files in, as all files will run significantly faster on a GPU.
